## About

This program stores data in an online Mongo Database as well as offline in an indexeddb database. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts and help
from the TA and LA it doesn't sync the two when coming online. Originally submitted this HW in FitnessTracker Week 18 because that was the week it was assigned in
(my cohort assignments are not in sync with central grading) but then thought it would be simpler to submit it under week 19 Progressive Budget which is the 
name of the HW.

## Usage 

This program was created using indexedDb as well as Mongo Database. It is simple enough for even a non-programmer to use.
