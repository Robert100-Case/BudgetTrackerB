## About

This program stores data in an online Mongo Database as well as offline in an indexeddb database. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts and help
from the TA and LA it doesn't sync the two when coming online. The proggram is being submitted under week18 Fitness Tracker because that was the week it was assigned 
in, our cohort is not in sync with the central grading schedule, we are covering things in a different order.

## Usage 

This program was created using indexedDb as well as Mongo Database. It is simple enough for even a non-programmer to use.
